### Outline

* handling exceptions
* custom exception classes
* antipatterns:
  - Exception as Control Flow
  - Error hiding / Exception swallowing
* error handling without try-catch
* regular expressions
  - detecting badly-formatted strings
  - outside error handling
    + capturing groups 
    + find and replace



### Have you encountered this?

![stopped](images/stopped.jpg)

Or maybe your game crashing for some strange reason?  Or some weird error message popup?



### Exceptions

* These errors are formally called **exceptions**
  - they are anomalous or exceptional conditions requiring special processing - during the execution
    of a program.
* Examples:
  - entering "very tall" for `int height`
  - your Flash drive got full while saving that 4K movie
  - submitting your Canvas assignment and the Internet connection suddenly vanishes
  - **DIVIDING AN INTEGER BY ZERO**
  - **THE FAMOUS NULL POINTER EXCEPTION**
    + designed as NoSuchMethodError in Dart
